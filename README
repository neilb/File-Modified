File::Modified version 0.02
=========================

This module provides an easy way for long running processes
(like daemons) to determine whether a file was changed since
the last time it was checked. Also, some persistence now 
allows you to use it as a more general caching mechanism.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

Digest     is optional but nice to have. If a script uses MD5 features, a fallback
           to checksums is available.
Test::More is needed to run the test script.
